This page will showcase results from our experiments.

### Overview of the experiments

Our experiments considered 3 factors that may affect the performance of the robot arm, namely RL algorithm, RNN memory enhancement, and state design. There are 8 different combinations of these factors so as the number of the experiment. The follow table showed the average reward of each of these models. 

**Average Reward for all the experiments**

| Experiment | 1.PPO+S1+RNN |  2.PPO+S2+RNN   | 3.PPO+S1+NO-RNN | 4.PPO+S2+NO-RNN  | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |  ----------- |
| Average Reward |      |         |       |     |       
| Std. of Reward |         |       |     |       |  

| Experiment |5.SAC+S1+RNN | 6.SAC+S2+RNN  | 7.SAC+S1+NO-RNN | 8.SAC+S2+NO-RNN      | NOTE|
| ----------- |  ----------- | ----------- |  ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Average Reward |      |         |       |           |        |
| Std. of Reward |         |       |       |         |         |
